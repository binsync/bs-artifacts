## Binaries
- `fauxware`: bare minimum C binary that has small functions and some global vars.
- `beanstalk_cpp`: a C++ binary that has uses of classes and vtables. Good test for scopes of types.
- `debug_symbol`: another C binary.
- `debug_symbol_mod_stripped`: stripped version of another binary.
- `posix_syscall`: C binary with unusual types and syscalls.
- `fdupes`: more complicated C binary
- `i2c_master_read-arduino_mzero.hex`: armel32 firmware in the unusual hex format. Causes strange loading problems in different decompilers.
